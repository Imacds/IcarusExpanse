All assets made by the team go in the corresponding folder in the Icarus Assets folder. Any assets imported into the project from outside sources
go outside the Icarus Assets folder. Do not overwrite existing work unless it is part of the dev plan decided by the team.

When making a new feature make a new branch. Do not make a new branch for a feature that already has a branch being worked on.

When you make a change make sure you explain it in detail in your commit message.
